# Tutorials

Welcome to the LangGraph Tutorials! These notebooks introduce LangGraph through building various language agents and applications.

## AgentExecutor

Learn to build a simple agent in LangGraph.

- [Base](agent_executor/base.ipynb): Learn to build a LangGraph agent "from scratch"
- [High-Level](agent_executor/high-level.ipynb): Learn to use the `create_agent_executor`

## Chat Agent Executor

Learn to build a simple chat agent executor, which is a basic graph with an agentic loop that also supports dialog with a user.

- [Base](chat_agent_executor_with_function_calling/base.ipynb): Build a chat agent executor with function calling
- [High-Level](chat_agent_executor_with_function_calling/high-level.ipynb): Using the high-level chat agent executor API
